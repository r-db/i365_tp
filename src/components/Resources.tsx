## Follow-up Templates

**Template 1: Post-Demo Follow-up**
Hi [Name], thanks for taking the time to see our AI Voice Agent demo today. Based on our conversation, I believe this could save you [specific benefit discussed]. When would be a good time to discuss next steps?

**Template 2: Missed Call Follow-up**
Hi [Name], I tried calling but couldn't reach you. I have some insights about how businesses like yours are capturing 40% more leads with 24/7 AI answering. Worth a quick 10-minute call?

**Template 3: Proposal Follow-up**
Hi [Name], following up on the proposal I sent over. The 24/7 AI answering service could start capturing those missed leads immediately. Any questions I can answer?

## Engagement Templates

**Template 4: Value Reminder**
Hi [Name], quick reminder that every missed call could be a lost customer. Our AI ensures you never miss another opportunity. Ready to get started?

**Template 5: Urgency Creator**
Hi [Name], we're seeing businesses lose an average of $2,400/month in missed opportunities. Our AI can eliminate that starting next week. Interested in a quick demo?

**Template 6: Social Proof**
Hi [Name], just helped another [industry] business capture 60% more leads with our AI Voice Agent. Similar results possible for you. 15-minute call to discuss?`

## Price Objections

**"It's too expensive"**
Response: "I understand price is a consideration. Let me ask you this - what's the cost of missing just one qualified lead per week? At your average transaction value, that's [calculate amount] per month. Our service pays for itself by capturing just 1-2 additional leads monthly."

**"We need to think about it"**
Response: "I completely understand wanting to make the right decision. What specific concerns do you have that I can address right now? Is it the investment, the implementation, or something else?"

## Technical Objections

**"We already have voicemail"**
Response: "That's exactly the problem we solve. Voicemail is where leads go to die. 80% of callers won't leave a message, and of those who do, only 30% get called back within 24 hours. Our AI answers every call live and captures every opportunity."

**"What if the AI makes mistakes?"**
Response: "Great question. Our AI is trained specifically for business conversations and has a 95% accuracy rate. Plus, every interaction is logged and can be reviewed. The bigger risk is missing calls entirely when no one's available to answer."

## Timing Objections

**"Now isn't a good time"**
Response: "I appreciate your honesty. When would be a better time? Keep in mind, every day you wait is another day of potentially missed opportunities. We can have you up and running in 24 hours."

**"We're too busy right now"**
Response: "Being too busy is exactly why you need this. Our AI handles the calls so you can focus on running your business. It actually gives you more time, not less."

## Authority Objections

**"I need to discuss with my partner/team"**
Response: "Absolutely, this affects the whole team. What questions do you think they'll have? Let me give you the information you'll need to present this properly. Would it help if I joined that conversation?"

**"I'm not the decision maker"**
Response: "I understand. Who else is involved in this decision? What's the best way to get them the information they need? Would a brief demo for the whole team make sense?"`
